Abstract 

The Indore city (commercial capital of Madhya Pradesh), India is facing challenges in managing storm and drainage water due to rapid urbanisation. 
To address this issue, there is a need for an effective and data-driven approach to understanding the problem and identifying potential solutions. 
The objective of this project is to analyse and visualise the data related to storm and drainage water in Indore, to identify patterns, trends, and 
areas of concern. The project aims to answer several questions related to the current state of storm and drainage water management, sources and impact 
of storm and drainage water, performance of the current management system during extreme weather events, areas prone to flooding and waterlogging, and 
potential solutions to the challenges faced by the city.
Effective management of water resources is an essential requirement to achieve sustainability in any developing country. With the growth of IoT-based 
sensors and data analytical tools, timely collection of data of water resources (storm water drainage and sewage system), integration with technical 
solutions for processing and visualisation through Data Visualization techniques is possible now. In order to develop a framework to achieve this goal, 
literature and related studies have been reviewed in this paper. This study provides scope for IoT, data analysis, and their integration for a framework 
to achieve sustainable growth for water resources. The visualisation result will help in improving the system's operations and infrastructure. The proposed 
framework will be improved further, based on practicality, cost-benefit, and environmental impact.
The project involves collecting, cleaning, and analysing data from various sources and visualising the data using various techniques, including maps, 
charts, and graphs, to develop a data-driven storm and drainage water management plan. The findings and recommendations will be communicated to stakeholders, 
including city officials, policymakers, and the general public, using clear and accessible data visualisation techniques. The study will utilise open data 
sets related to storm and drainage water in Indore, including datasets from anyone resource from Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India, Kaggle,  India 
Water Portal, and suitable tools from  Excel, R, Python, Tableau, and GIS software if time permits  such as ArcGIS or QGIS. The study aims to provide data 
driven insights that can help in managing an effective storm and drainage water management plan towards reducing the impact of extreme weather events on the 
city.
